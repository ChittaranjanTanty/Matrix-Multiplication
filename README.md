Here I have created my first project and successfully pushed into the remote but having issues with the code. I have created a function calculateResult under which i am forming the n*n matrix for user input. 
Under this funtion i have created another function cal() in which i am taking the input and do calculation then displaying the output. for calculateResult() i have used the buttton createMatrices and for cal() using
another button named calculate. i called the cal() inside calculateResult(). so the first button is working correctly. but when i am using the calculate button which is for cal() it's not doing the task. 
i am getting the default multiplication value that i have placed inside calculateresult(). please help me with it.
